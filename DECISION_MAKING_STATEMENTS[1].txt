Q-9 : Sece Dining

The catering staff in the SECE mess are known for their good cooking skills as well as hospitality. We all know that the dining table arrangement needs to be different for left handed and right handed persons. So whenever any VIP guests come to SECE, they would make the table arrangements based on whether they are left handed or right handed. The mess is situated on the 15th floor of the hostel building. SECE hostel building has superfast elevators to help to travel from one floor to another. Each elevator has 2 doors, the front one and the rear one. If a person enters the elevator through the front door, he goes out through the rear door and vice-versa. The elevator has 2 rails numbered as 1 and 2. Rail 1 is located to the left of the entrance to the front door (or correspondingly, to the right of the entrance to the rear door). Rail 2 is located opposite it, to the right of the entrance to the front door and to the left of the entrance to the rear door. We know that each person holds on the rail with his/her strongest hand. There is an IP camera in the elevator and based on the camera output, the catering staff will be easily able to identify whether a guest is left handed or right handed. They have decided to automate this task and they asked the help of Image Processing Group. The Image Processing Group has written a program to perform this task and the program will output the door through which the person entered and the rail number which the person held. Based on this input, write a program to determine whether a person is left handed or right handed?


Input format:

The first input containing a string denotes “front” or “rear”

The second input containing an integer denotes rail 1 or 2

Q-12 : Time sheet

Jeevitha just started work as a programming trainer for UIT's Placement Cell. She is paid Rs.100 an hour, with a few exceptions. She earns an extra Rs.15 an hour for any part of a day where she works more than 8 hours, and an extra Rs.25 an hour for hours beyond 40 in any one week. Also, she earns a 25% bonus for working on Saturday and a 50% bonus for working on Sunday. The bonuses for Saturday and Sunday are computed based on the hours worked those days; they are not used to calculate any bonus for working more than 40 hours in a week. You'll be given the number of hours Jeevitha worked on each day in a week (Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday), and you need to compute her salary for the week. Input format: Input consists of 7 integers less than or equal to 24 on separate lines Output format: Print the Jeevith's salary for a week.
